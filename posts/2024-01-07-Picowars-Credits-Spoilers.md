## Heyo! 

So a while back I created this PICO8 game <a href="https://lambdanaut.itch.io/picowars">Picowars</a> and it did pretty well. Some people liked it wow! I even still get around a dozen people playing it daily which is pretty awesome if u ask me. Better than I would have originally thought! 

I'm even going to be a panelist at PAX East 2024 in Boston (Sunday 24th @ 11pm) with several gamedevs who have made de-makes before, including the Portal64 guy who I'm really looking forward to meeting. It was a surprise, and I'm so excited and glad that I'll be able to make it work. 


## Promised Spoilers

Anyways, here are the spoilers I promised. This isn't an easy screen to reach as you have to beat the entire game to get here, but I want to have it online because I put a lot of time into it and it makes my heart feel when I watch it.
