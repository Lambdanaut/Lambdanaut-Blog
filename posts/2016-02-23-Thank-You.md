What is it that divides me from you? 

Where is that barrier? 

You exist, floating in your own universe, and I rip you away. 

I'm sorry. 

I'll try to see you clearly, as myself. 

A teacher has shown me the possibilities, but I fail on my own. 

I'm looking closer. 

It's an urgent sense, deep inside. A fear that things must be a way. 

How did that fear manifest? 

And where does it live inside? 

Maybe I'm my body as much as my mind. 

Thank you

Thank you

I want to look directly in your eyes

Thank you
