title: My Life Right Now (Burns, Buns, and Gamedev)
---

Hey hey hey! 

Life is shifting fast lately. I'm all "they/them" these days, and getting my own space away from my "primary partner" who is now more of a "just-like-all-my-other-partners" partner. It's good though. It's all really good. Going to burns a lot; spinning fire a lot; and I won 3rd place medal in a booty pagent at the last one I went to. Check it, parentals!

Bam. Content. Feeling content. 

Also so much roleplaying this year. I met these hella sweet kids and we roleplay character shit. Fun stuff. Good therapy too. Really got to know myself by being not myself. 

Some of my characters:

Other than that, progress has started back up on my Gamedev project: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23overworld&src=typed_query">Overworld</a>. Here's some in-game aesthetics showoff:

It's a video! Watch it!

Also working on a couple top secret art projects for burns. Super excited to talk about them, but not yet! Soonish for sure.
